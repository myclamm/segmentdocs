<section>

<p>Payments can fail for a variety of reasons and it’s frustrating whenever they represent a loss of legitimate business. Certain failures are actually preventative measures–working to minimize the possibility of a fraudulent payment that otherwise may have resulted in a dispute.</p>

<p>There are three possible reasons why a payment might fail, and there is a different way of handling each failure. The reason for a payment’s failure is provided within the payment’s details in the Dashboard and through the API as part of the Charge object’s <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#charge_object-outcome"><code>outcome</code></a>. This parameter includes the type of payment failure, along with additional information about the reason for it.</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 id="bank-declines">Bank-declined payments</h2>
<p>When a charge is submitted to the bank or card issuer of your customer’s card, they have automated systems that determine whether or not to authorize it. These systems take various signals into account, such as your customer’s spending habits, account balance, and card information like the expiration date and CVC.</p>

<p>If your customer’s bank or card issuer declines a payment, Stripe shares with you as much information explaining the decline as we receive, both within the Dashboard and through the API. In some cases, banks also provide helpful explanations, such as the card number or expiration date being incorrect, or that the customer does not have enough funds available to make the payment. The bank may provide one of these more specific reasons to Stripe through the use of a <a href="#decline-codes">decline code</a>.</p>

<div class="image full">
  <p><a href="https://stripe.com/img/documentation/declines/declined-payment-with-code.png" class="zoomable" data-width="1024" data-height="624"><img src="https://stripe.com/img/documentation/declines/declined-payment-with-code.png" width="100%" /></a></p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, most declines are categorized as “generic” so it’s not always possible to know exactly why a payment was declined. If all of the card information seems correct, it is best to have your customer contact their bank and ask for more information. For privacy and security, banks and card issuers can only discuss the specifics of a declined payment with their cardholders–they cannot discuss this with the merchant.</p>

<p>Through the API, the <code>outcome</code> of a bank-declined charge contains the type of payment failure that’s occurred and provides the reason using the decline code received by the bank:</p><div class="code">
  <pre class="language-javascript numbered"  data-highlight-lines="5,8"><code>...
outcome:
{
  network_status: &quot;declined_by_network&quot;
  reason: &quot;expired_card&quot;
  risk_level: &quot;normal&quot;
  seller_message: &quot;The bank returned the decline code `expired_card`.&quot;
  type: &quot;issuer_declined&quot;
},
...
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="reducing-bank-declines">Reducing bank declines</h3>
<p>Bank declines arising from incorrect card information (e.g., incorrect card number or expiration date) are best handled by guiding your customer to correct the error or even using another card or payment method. For instance, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout">Checkout</a> can provide feedback to the customer if the card they’re attempting to use is declined, allowing them to try again or use an alternative payment method.</p>

<p>Banks’ suspicions of fraudulent activity are more challenging to manage, but having customers provide the CVC and ZIP code when checking out can significantly decrease the number of declines you’re experiencing. The influence of other data that you collect, like the full address, varies by card brand and country. If you are still experiencing a higher-than-expected number of declined payments, consider collecting this additional data.</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 id="blocked-payments">Blocked payments</h2>
<p>Stripe’s automated fraud prevention toolset, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/radar">Radar</a>, blocks any payments that we identify as being high-risk. Radar can help you most effectively combat fraud, with features such as rules that <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/avoiding-fraud-and-disputes">block payments if the CVC or ZIP code doesn’t match</a> the information on file with your customer’s bank.</p>

<div class="image full">
  <p><a href="https://stripe.com/img/documentation/radar/payment-high-risk.png" class="zoomable" data-width="1024" data-height="624"><img src="https://stripe.com/img/documentation/radar/payment-high-risk.png" width="100%" /></a></p>
</div>

<p>Using the API, the <code>outcome</code> of a blocked payment reflects the type of payment failure and the reason for it, along with the risk level that was evaluated.</p><div class="code">
  <pre class="language-javascript numbered"  data-highlight-lines="5,6,8"><code>...
outcome:
{
  network_status: &quot;not_sent_to_network&quot;
  reason: &quot;highest_risk_level&quot;
  risk_level: &quot;highest&quot;
  seller_message: &quot;Stripe blocked this charge as too risky.&quot;
  type: &quot;blocked&quot;
},
...
</code></pre>
</div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="invalid-api-calls">Invalid API calls</h2>
<p>As you develop your Stripe integration, good testing should identify any potential bugs that would lead to invalid API calls.  Consequently these failures should be rare in production. Invalid API call typically don’t result in a payment appearing in your Dashboard. However, in a few edge cases you may see the payment appear.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="language-javascript numbered" data-highlight-lines="5"><code>...
outcome:
{
  network_status: &quot;not_sent_to_network&quot;
  type: &quot;invalid&quot;
},
...
</code></pre>
</div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="responding-to-failures-api">Managing payment failures programmatically</h2>
<p>If you would like your integration to respond to payment failures automatically, you can access a charge’s <code>outcome</code> in two ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#handling-errors">Handle the API error</a> returned when a payment fails. For blocked and bank-declined payments, the error includes the charge’s ID, which you can then use to <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_charge">retrieve</a> the charge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
