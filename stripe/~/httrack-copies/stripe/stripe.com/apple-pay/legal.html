In addition, on any webpage where a Comparable Platform is offered, You agree to call the ‘CanMakePayment’ API, and if a user has a device capable of supporting the Apple Pay Platform, then You agree to also offer the Apple Pay Platform as a payment option on the same webpage of such Websites;</p>

  <p>(f) Your Websites must: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code, or other internal component (e.g. computer viruses, trojan horses, “backdoors”), which could damage, destroy, or adversely affect Apple hardware, software or services, or other third party software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>not interfere with security, user interface, user experience, features or functionality of Safari, macOS, or other Apple Products;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify the user that the user’s location data, address book data, calendar, photos, audio data, and/or reminders are being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use; or </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>(g) If any Website includes any Public Software, You shall comply with all licensing terms applicable to such Public Software.  You shall not use, or authorize the use of, any Public Software in the development of the Websites in such a way that would cause the non-Public Software portions of the Apple Pay Web APIs or Apple Pay Platform to be subject to any Public Software licensing terms or obligations.</p>

  <p>(h) All information provided by You to Apple or Your end-users in connection with these Terms and Conditions or Your Websites, will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete and, with regard to information You provide to Apple, You will promptly notify Apple of any changes to such information.  Further, You agree that Apple may share such information (including email address and mailing address) with third parties who have a need to know for purposes related thereto (e.g., intellectual property questions, customer service inquiries, etc.).</p>

  <p>(i) To the extent that You access or receive an Apple Pay Payload, You agree to use the Apple Pay Payload solely to process the end-user payment transaction and for other uses that You disclose to the end-user, and only in accordance with Applicable Law. </p>

  <p>(j) If Apple makes available new versions of the Apple Pay Web APIs for any reason, including without limitation to address a security breach or security vulnerability regarding Personal Data, update the customer experience, or provide additional features or functionality, then You agree to update all of Your Websites to incorporate such new version within a reasonable time period.</p>

  <p>(k) To the best of Your knowledge and belief, Your Websites do not and will not violate, misappropriate, or infringe any Apple or third party copyrights, trademarks, rights of privacy and publicity, trade secrets, patents, or other proprietary or legal rights (e.g., musical composition or performance rights, video rights, photography or image rights, logo rights, third party data rights, etc. for content and materials that may be included in Your Websites).</p>

  <p>(l) You agree not to disadvantage or discriminate against Apple relative to other Comparable Platforms with respect to the display and availability the Apple Pay Platform from or through the Websites. For the avoidance of doubt, the “Apple Pay” button must be displayed as a payment option on Your Websites on parity with any other Comparable Platform. In addition, You will not process or decline transactions, establish transaction, authentication, or other limits applicable to Websites, or implement, suspend, or discontinue Websites in a manner that discriminates against transactions on the basis of their participation in the Program.</p>

  <p>If You or Your Affiliates breach any of the foregoing restrictions, You may be subject to prosecution and damages.  All licenses not expressly granted in these Terms and Conditions are reserved and no other licenses, immunity or rights, express or implied are granted by Apple, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.  </p>

You acknowledge that Apple has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any Updates to the Apple Pay Web APIs or Apple Pay Platform to anyone in the future.

Further, You acknowledge and agree that such Updates may affect Your or Your Affiliates’ ability to use, access, or interact with the Apple Pay Web APIs and Apple Pay Platform.</p>

  <p>(b) Apple is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the Apple Pay Web APIs or Apple Pay Platform.

  <h2 id="platform-providers">4. Platform Providers</h2>
  <p>Unless otherwise prohibited by Apple, You may employ or retain a Platform Provider to assist You in using and incorporating the Apple Pay Web APIs into Websites pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, provided that any such Platform Provider’s use of the Apple Pay Web APIs or any materials associated therewith is done solely on Your behalf and only in accordance with a separate written agreement between Apple and such Platform Provider. In the event of any actions or inactions by the Platform Provider that would constitute a violation of these Terms and Conditions or otherwise cause any harm, Apple reserves the right to require You to cease using such Platform Provider.  In connection with Your use of a Platform Provider, You authorize such Platform Provider to (a) provide certain reports that may contain data related to Your participation in the Program; and (b) disclose to Apple and its Affiliates information related to You and Your Websites in connection with these Terms and Conditions or the Program, including without limitation information about Your Websites and metadata (such disclosures referred to herein as <em>“Merchant Disclosures”</em>). You grant Apple the right and license to use any information described in (a) and (b) above for purposes of Apple (i) performing its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms and Conditions, and (ii) improving the Apple Pay Platform or Program.  You agree that Apple’s use of such Merchant Disclosures will not be subject to any confidentiality obligations.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, Apple will be free to use and disclose any Merchant Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You.</p>

  <h2 id="confidentiality">5. Confidentiality</h2>

  <h3 id="information-deemed-apple-confidential">5.1 Information Deemed Apple Confidential.</h3>
  <p>You agree that Apple Metrics and any and all information related to the Apple Pay Platform that is obtained, generated or created by or on behalf of Apple will be deemed “Apple Confidential Information”.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, or (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation.  </p>

  <h3 id="obligations-regarding-apple-confidential-information">5.2 Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information.</h3>
  <p>You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.  You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under these Terms and Conditions and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple’s prior written consent.  You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those of Your employees and contractors, who have a need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the Apple Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple.  You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by Applicable Law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information.  You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.</p>

  <h3 id="apple-metrics">5.3 Apple Metrics.</h3>
  <p>You shall not disclose Apple Metrics without Apple’s prior written consent, including disclosures of metrics that do not specifically reference the Apple Pay Platform but enable recipients to reasonably infer Apple Confidential Information from such metrics.
