                    <h3>We think that building an internet business is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance. Our developer-friendly APIs let our users focus on building great products.</h3>
                    <p>We love the web, and care deeply about beautiful code, APIs, and documentation. We really like startups and building products—the people at Stripe have previously helped start Skype, Lala, Act Blue, Kickoff, Interstate, Auctomatic, Encyclopedia, GazeHawk, and Wesabe.</p>
                    <p>Stripe's investors include Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and Elon Musk.</p>
