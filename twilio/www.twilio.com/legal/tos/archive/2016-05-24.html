Our Services enable connectivity and the easy integration of telecommunications capabilities into software applications, including mobile, web-based and desktop applications.</p><p>Twilio provides its Services subject to the terms and conditions in this Terms of Service (<strong>“Terms”</strong>). When we refer to our <strong>“Services”</strong> in these Terms, we mean to include the whole enchilada -- our platform services, which includes all of our programs, features, functions and report formats, instructions, code samples, the TwiML markup language, on-line help files and technical documentation, our website, account portal, technical support, as well as any upgrades or updates to any of these, made generally available by us, and includes any of our SDKs, APIs or software provided to you in connection with your use of our services, and our connectivity services.</p><p>To be eligible to register for a Twilio account and use Twilio’s Services, you must review and accept the terms of this Agreement by clicking on the “I Accept” button or other mechanism provided. <strong>PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. ONCE ACCEPTED, THESE TERMS BECOME A BINDING LEGAL COMMITMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TWILIO.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT CLICK THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE TWILIO’S SERVICES.</strong></p><p>In this Agreement, “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>Twilio</strong>” will refer to Twilio Inc., 645 Harrison Street, Third Floor, San Francisco, CA 94107.

For more details, go to Sections 11 and 13.</p><p>IN ADDITION, DISPUTES ABOUT THESE TERMS OR RELATING TO YOUR TWILIO ACCOUNT OR TWILIO’S SERVICES GENERALLY MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.

Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/contact">Customer Support</a>.  Most disputes can be resolved that way.</p><p>17.1 <span class="emphasis">We Both Agree to Arbitrate</span>. If we can’t resolve our dispute through our customer support, you or any of your affiliates on one hand and Twilio and any of Twilio’s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms, or Privacy Notices, or in relation to our Services by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, or in another location that we have both agreed to.</p><p>This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one the exceptions below in Subsection 17.2  (Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate).  It also applies even after you have stopped using your Twilio account or have deleted it.  If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</p><p><strong>Under this Section 17 (Agreement to Arbitrate), you understand that you and your affiliates and Twilio and its affiliates are giving up the right to have a judge and/or jury resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or Twilio’s Services.</strong></p><p>17.2 <span class="emphasis">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</span>. You and your affiliates on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</p><p class='indents'>(1) Your, your affiliate’s, Twilio’s or Twilio’s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents); or</p><p class='indents'>(2) Your violation of Twilio’s AUP.</p><p>Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.</p><p>In addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Any of us may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p><p>17.3 <span class="emphasis">Details of Arbitration Procedure</span>. Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties.  If mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website <a href="http://www.adr.org/">http://www.adr.org</a> or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.</p><p>The arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. To the extent any thing described in this Section 17 conflicts with the Rules, the language of this Section 17 applies.</p><p>Each of us will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions. All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. This Section 17 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.</p><p>The arbitrator’s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award. The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.</p><p>Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>17.4 <span class="emphasis">Class Action Waiver</span>.  Both you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other on an individual basis only.   That means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.  The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).  And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Twilio customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.</p><p>If a court decides that this Subsection 17.4 (Class Action Waiver) is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 17 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p><h3><a name='fun'></a>18.
