of Service</h3><p><em>We’ve updated our Terms of Service (“Terms”), which will be effective starting May 24, 2016. If you want to review our old Terms of Service, effective before May 24, 2016 click <a href="tos/archive/2016-05-24.html">here</a>.</em></p><p>On May 24, 2016, we made some tweaks to the Terms of Service to address the new Twilio Marketplace Add-ons and also to provide a “human readable” translation of the terms.</p><h4>What we have NOT changed</h4><p>We have not changed your ability to use our products and services. You may continue to access your Twilio account and use our products and services as you always have.</p><p>If you have a separate contract with Twilio covering your account and use of our services, these new Terms will not apply to you.</p><h4>What we HAVE changed</h4><p><strong>February 1, 2016 Changes:</strong></p><p>We have changed the format and tone of the Terms to make them easier to understand by taking out as much legalese as our lawyers will allow.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the bigger changes we want to point out to you:</p><p><strong>3. Your Account(s):</strong> We have added language to explain the account creation process. For certain phone numbers (we’ll let you know which), you must now provide an address.</p><p><strong>5. Our Use and Storage of Customer Data:</strong> We have added a clearer definition of “customer data” and explained when we may be required to disclose it. We’ve also added a link to our update privacy notices. Check it out here.</p><p><strong>6. Restrictions:</strong>
(f) If you have purchased a short code through Twilio, then you had to indicate how you are going to use it and you may not change this use without Twilio’s approval. We’ll approve a change if we can, but it’s not always up to us.
(g) If you don’t use the Twilio numbers in your account, we can reclaim them, although we will tell you before we do.
(h) In general, you may port away your phone numbers as long as certain requirements are met.</p><p><strong>7. Export Controls:</strong> You must now promise to comply with all export laws and regulations.</p><p><strong>8. Affiliates:</strong> Your affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, parent companies, etc.) may order Twilio services under these Terms.</p><p><strong>10.2. Suggestions and Contributions:</strong> Please tell us what you think of our services, send us suggestions about improvements and additions, but please understand that we can use your feedback free of charge or any other obligations.</p><p><strong>11.2 Beta Service:</strong> If you use any of our services while they are in a beta stage, you understand that they may have some bugs that still need to be worked out.</p><p><strong>May 24, 2016 Updates:</strong></p><p>We did not make any updates that will impact your use of any existing Twilio products or services.</p><p>Instead, we just added a section to address the new Twilio Marketplace and your use of Add-ons.</p><p>We also added, as a courtesy, a “human readable” translation of the terms. This “human readable” translation doesn’t change any of the language of the “official” terms.</p><p>While we’ve done our best to make our Terms complete, readable, and understandable, you may still have additional questions. We get that. So, feel free to contact our support team at <a href="mailto:help@twilio.com">help@twilio.com</a>.</p><p>Or, if you prefer, you may write to us at:</p><p class="column">

</p><div class="page-header"><h1 class="page-title">Twilio Terms of Service</h1><h2 class="legal__updated">Last Updated May 24, 2016</h2></div><p>Ahoy! And welcome to Twilio!</p><p>Twilio is a cloud communications company. Our services enable connectivity and the easy integration of telecommunications capabilities into software applications, including mobile, web-based and desktop applications.</p><p>This is our terms of service. As a courtesy to you, on the left side, we’ve done our best to translate the legalese into a “human readable” format (though our legal team assures us that lawyers are humans, too). You should know though that the language on the right is the legally binding stuff.</p><hr /><p><aside></p><p>Unless you work for a company that has negotiated a separate agreement with us, these are the terms that apply to your use of Twilio. You should read them.</p><p>And, heads up, you should really check out Sections 11 and 13 because they limit our liability to you if something goes wrong.</p><p>Also, if we get into a dispute, we’ll have to figure it out in arbitration. Check out Section 17 for more details.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p>Twilio provides its Services subject to the terms and conditions in this Terms of Service (“<em>Terms</em>" or “<em>Agreement</em>"). When we refer to our “<em>Services</em>" in these Terms, we mean to include the whole enchilada -- our platform services, which includes all of our programs, features, functions and report formats, instructions, code samples, the TwiML markup language, on-line help files and technical documentation, our website, account portal, technical support, Add-ons as well as any upgrades or updates to any of these, made generally available by us, and includes any of our SDKs, APIs or software provided to you in connection with your use of our services, and our connectivity services.</p><p>To be eligible to register for a Twilio account and use Twilio’s Services, you must review and accept the terms of this Agreement by clicking on the “I Accept” button or other mechanism provided. <strong>PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. ONCE ACCEPTED, THESE TERMS BECOME A BINDING LEGAL COMMITMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TWILIO. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT CLICK THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE TWILIO’S SERVICES.</strong></p><p>In this Agreement, “we,” “us,” “our” or “Twilio” will refer to Twilio Inc., 375 Beale Street, Suite 300,
San Francisco, CA 94105. And, the terms “you,” “your” and “Customer” will refer to you. If you are registering for a Twilio account or using Twilio’s services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these terms for that organization and promising Twilio that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (and, in which case, the terms “you” and “your” or “customer” will refer to that organization). The exception to this is if that organization has a separate contract with Twilio covering your account and use of our Services, in which case that contract will govern your account and use of Twilio’s Services.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: TWILIO DOESN’T PROVIDE WARRANTIES FOR ITS SERVICES, AND THESE TERMS LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU. For more details, go to Sections 11 and 13.</strong></p><p><strong>IN ADDITION, DISPUTES ABOUT THESE TERMS OR RELATING TO YOUR TWILIO ACCOUNT OR TWILIO’S SERVICES GENERALLY MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. For more details, go to Section 17.</strong></p><p>If you have any questions, you can reach the Twilio team at <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">twilio.com/help/contact</a>.</p><p>If you are a U.S. federal government user or otherwise accessing or using any Twilio service in a U.S. federal government capacity, <a href="amendment-tos.html">this Amendment</a> to these Terms applies to you.</p><p></section></p><p><section></p><ol><li><a href='#changes_terms'>Changes to These Terms</a></li><li><a href='#changes_services'>Changes to Our Services</a></li><li><a href='#accounts'>Your Account(s)</a></li><li><a href='#access'>Access and Use of Our Services</a></li><li><a href='#our_use'>Our Use and Storage of Customer Data</a></li><li><a href='#restrictions'>Restrictions</a></li><li><a href='#export'>Export Controls</a></li><li><a href='#affiliates'>Affiliates</a></li><li><a href='#add-ons'>Add-ons</a></li><li><a href='#fees'>Fees, Payment Terms, Taxes</a></li><li><a href='#ownership'>Ownership and Confidentiality</a></li><li><a href='#warranties'>Warranties and Disclaimers</a></li><li><a href='#indemnification'>Indemnification</a></li><li><a href='#exclusion'>Exclusion of Damages; Limitations of Liability</a></li><li><a href='#termination'>Termination of These Terms</a></li><li><a href='#survival'>Survival</a></li><li><a href='#general'>General</a></li><li><a href='#agreement'>Agreement to Arbitrate</a></li><li><a href='#fun'>Fun</a></li></ol><p></section></p><p><section id="changes_terms" class="title"></p><h3>1. Changes to These Terms</h3><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>These terms might change. But we’ll send you an email and let you know before we make any significant changes that impact you or your use of our services. If you keep using Twilio after the terms change, then you have accepted those changes.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we do, those revised Terms will supersede prior versions. Unless we say otherwise, revisions will be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms. We will provide you advance notice of any material revisions. This notice will be provided via the account portal and/or via an email to the email address we have on file. For other revisions, we will update the effective date of these Terms at the top of the page. We encourage you to check the effective date of these Terms whenever you visit Twilio’s website or account portal. Your continued access or use of our Services constitutes your acceptance of any revisions. If you don’t agree to the revisions, you should stop using Twilio’s Services and we are not obligated to provide you with the Services.</p><p></section></p><p><section id="changes_services" class="title"></p><h3>2. Changes to Our Services</h3><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>We are always looking to innovate and make Twilio better, so our SLA (which stands for “service level agreement”) and APIs may change over time. We will let you know in advance if any API changes aren’t backwards-compatible.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p>The features and functions of our Services, including our APIs, and Twilio’s service level agreement (SLA), may change over time. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to our Services are compatible with our then-current Services. Although we try to avoid making changes to our Services that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, we will use reasonable efforts to let you know at least sixty (60) days prior to implementing those changes.</p><p></section></p><p><section id="accounts" class="title"></p><h3>3. Your Account(s)</h3><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>If you want to use Twilio, you need to create a Twilio account. To create an account, you need to give us some information about yourself. The information you provide must be true and you have to keep it up to date.</p><p>You are responsible for anything that happens under your account.</p><p>Also, for some phone numbers, we need to have a physical address on file for you. So, please send us your new physical address if you move.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p>To use our Services, you will be asked to create an account.

Restrictions</h3><p></section></p><p><aside class="ol--lower-alpha"></p><p>Some “dos and don’ts” on Twilio:</p><ol><li>Don’t transfer our services, resell them, etc., except as allowed under Section 4.</li><li>Don’t use Twilio to try to contact emergency services unless you have agreed to Twilio’s special “911 Terms”. (If you aren’t sure if you have, then you probably haven’t.)</li><li>Don’t use Twilio to break the law, to violate these terms, to violate our AUP, or to violate someone else’s rights.</li><li>Do make sure that Twilio is allowed to use your data as needed to provide you the service.</li><li>Don’t reverse engineer, etc. any software we provide.</li><li>If you buy a short code from us, only use it how you said you would use it.</li></ol><p>If you don’t send enough traffic on a phone number, then we may have to take it back. This is because some states require a minimum amount of use for each phone number. If the minimum isn’t met, they take back those numbers so that they can give to someone else who’s going to actually use them. This is definitely a big deal in regions that are running out of phone numbers with certain area codes.</p><p>Technically, Twilio is the “customer of record” for the phone numbers we give you.

If we seek to reclaim a phone number from your account, excluding suspended and trial accounts, we will send you an email at least two (2) weeks' in advance telling you that we are reclaiming the phone number, unless we’re otherwise prevented from doing so by the applicable regulatory agency or governmental organization. We also reserve the right to reclaim phone numbers from accounts suspended for failure to pay and/or suspended for suspected fraud, and to reclaim phone numbers in free trial accounts that are unutilized for more than thirty (30) days.</li><li>You acknowledge that we are the “customer of record” for all phone numbers provided as part of our Services.

The enforceability and interpretation of Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be determined the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions).

These Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Except as provided in Section 18 (Arbitration), any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services shall be instituted in either the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California, and we each consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p><p></section></p><p><section id="agreement" class="title"></p><h3>18. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>Please, please, please reach out to our Customer Support Team (they’re amazing!) before bringing a legal case.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p>Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support. Most disputes can be resolved that way.</p><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>If our Customer Support Team can’t help you, then we both agree to go to binding arbitration, again, in San Francisco, California.</p><p>Arbitration means a professional arbitrator will decide how to resolve our dispute instead of a judge or a jury deciding the case.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p><strong>18.1 We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</strong> If we can’t resolve our dispute through our customer support, you or any of your affiliates on one hand and Twilio and any of Twilio’s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms, or Privacy Notices, or in relation to our Services by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, or in another location that we have both agreed to.</p><p>This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one the exceptions below in Subsection 18.2 (Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate). It also applies even after you have stopped using your Twilio account or have deleted it. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</p><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>Despite what we said above, there are some disputes that won’t go to arbitration, but to court, like IP disputes and disputes about your violation of our AUP.</p><p>We also don’t have to arbitrate small claims court cases.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p><strong>18.2 Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> You and your affiliates on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</p><ol><li>Your, your affiliate’s, Twilio’s or Twilio’s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents); or</li><li>Your violation of Twilio’s AUP.</li></ol><p>Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.</p><p>In addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Any of us may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>If we arbitrate, then we’ll do it through the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Before we even arbitrate, though, we’ll try mediation with a AAA mediator. If mediation doesn’t work, then we’ll go to arbitration through AAA with only one arbitrator (one is so much easier). And remember, the arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p><strong>18.3 Details of Arbitration Procedure.</strong> Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties. If mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website http://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.</p><p>The arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. To the extent any thing described in this Section 18 conflicts with the Rules, the language of this Section 18 applies.</p><p>Each of us will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions. All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. This Section 18 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.</p><p>The arbitrator’s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award. The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.</p><p>Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p></section></p><p><aside></p><p>We both agree not to bring a class action suit against the other.</p><p>If for some reason a court decides that this term isn’t enforceable, then the entire Section 18 will go away.</p><p></aside></p><p><section></p><p><strong>18.4 Class Action Waiver.</strong> Both you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other on an individual basis only. That means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Twilio customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.</p><p>If a court decides that this Subsection 18.4 (Class Action Waiver) is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p><p></section></p><p><section id="fun" class="title"></p><h3>19.
