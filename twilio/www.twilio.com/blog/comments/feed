		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nadeem, unfortunately we still don&#039;t have numbers in Pakistan, but you can get any SMS enabled number (i.e. American, British, German, etc) and you will be able to send messages to Pakistan.

You can also signup for notifications so we let you know when we have Pakistani numbers. You can read more about it here: https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/226690868

Hope this helps you out, and please do not hesitate in reaching back if you have any more questions.

Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Isaias,

Thanks for your comment. That will be because our numbers in Peru still aren&#039;t SMS enabled. We&#039;re constantly working to bring extra functionalities to numbers around the world, but some countries take slightly longer than others. My suggestion in this case would be to get a number from a country nearby like Chile where SMS is enabled. You will then be able to send messages from that number.

You can also signup for updates so you get notified when SMS is enabled in Peru. Have a look at this article: https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/226690868

Hope this helps you out, and please do not hesitate getting in touch if you need any more help.

Cheers]]></description>
