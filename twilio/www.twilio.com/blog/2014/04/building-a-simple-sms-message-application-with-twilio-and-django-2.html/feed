		<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul,


Loved your post and while it has helped me a bit, I&#039;d love if you could help me out of a jam.


Here&#039;s the deal:


Two of my best friends are getting married in a couple of weeks. I&#039;ve had this idea to have a &quot;marriage texting diary&quot; which will ask them a simple question (eg. &quot;How was your day? What do you want to remember from today?) each day for the first year of their marriage, then I&#039;ll compile all their responses and print a book for their 1st anniversary.


Sounds cute, right?


Well the challenge is that I&#039;m not technically proficient by any means. I know nothing about coding or database architecture and while I&#039;ve been trying to learn, it has been a real challenge.


Any chance you could help me out/point me in the right direction?


Your assistance would mean a ton to me and to the newlyweds.


Thanks in advance,


Jonah]]></description>
