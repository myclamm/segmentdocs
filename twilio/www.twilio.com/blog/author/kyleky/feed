				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few hold the keys to the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/login">Twilio Console</a>, but many need Console data. As the developer with keys, you balance sharing valuable data with keeping that Console data safe.</p>
<p>You can’t give away the keys when a team member needs info on a single message. The alternative of pulling reports manually for each request is also infeasible &#8212; especially when you’re fighting bad guys.</p>
<p>A long-standing Twilio customer specializing in human trafficking investigations contracted developer Kevin Burke to build a tool that satisfies the needs of the keyholder and the needs of the person looking for data. That client (graciously) chose to open-source the project for the benefit of Twilio customers everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/saintpete/logrole">Logrole</a> is a Go-based tool that enables organizations to delegate limited, role-based access to Twilio logs and search them faster and with more granularity. It also allows others to get the data they’re looking for on their own, securely.</p>
<h3>Giving Users The Log Access They Need (And Nothing More)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19405" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime.png" alt="logroletime" width="1239" height="619" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime.png 1239w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime-300x150.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime-768x384.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime-1024x512.png 1024w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleTime-200x100.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px" /></p>
<p>Developers can set customizable permissions for their Twilio Logs. Now teams without the keys can independently access the data they need, and only the data they need.</p>
<p>Logrole lets you limit access to the body of SMS &amp; MMS messages and limits searches past a certain date. This was particularly important for the client in shielding their support agents from sensitive images. Account SIDs are hidden from end users, and URLs may be enabled or disabled based on the technical needs of the end user. That’s the security side of Logrole; the UX side is the meat of the tool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19406" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LogroleSearch.gif" alt="logrolesearch" width="764" height="250" /></p>
<p>Logrole was designed to make it easier for teams to search for and work with Twilio data. For example, my 9am is different than my co-worker’s 9am. I’m in San Francisco. They’re in New York. Logrole is time-zone aware and specific to each user so you don’t have to google “Mountain Time to Pacific Time” before you search.</p>
<p>Take a look at the other time-saving hacks into built into Logrole. The tool also allows you to search Resource SIDs straight from your browser. You can search or paste any SID to jump straight to it.</p>
<h3>Building With Go</h3>
<p>It only took Kevin Burke a month to build Logrole, thanks in no small part to choosing Go.</p>
<p>“I really like the standard library, I like that it runs pretty quickly when you run it and doesn&#8217;t take a lot of memory to do so. You can also do really cool stuff with coordinating requests across multiple threads (and canceling them all at once) that are very difficult to accomplish in other languages,” says Kevin.</p>
<p>“I developed a separate <a href="https://github.com/saintpete/twilio-go">twilio-go library</a> as a part of the project. It&#8217;s the only client library that can filter calls and SMS by start/end, down to the millisecond. There are a bunch of other nice features as well; I&#8217;d encourage Go users to check it out.”</p>
<p>If you’re a Twilio or Go fan (or both) you can check out the library <a href="https://github.com/saintpete/twilio-go">here</a>, and grab Logrole on GitHub right <a href="https://github.com/saintpete/logrole">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the holidays I flew from San Francisco to New York with a stop in Denver. United Airlines delayed my flight from Denver to New York two hours. They said it might get cancelled. I called their customer support department, who didn&#8217;t help, and waited on hold for a supervisor. With all this time on my hands, I <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKellyYahner/status/810619301837225984">sent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKellyYahner/status/810627002730364928">them</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKellyYahner/status/810632210894049280">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKellyYahner/status/810637786202017793">tweets</a>. I waited for an hour and 30 minutes before hanging up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If someone from United had actually answered, I could have told them that building callback capability isn&#8217;t hard. Instead of spending my time listening to elevator music over the phone on hold, I could have thrown my phone number into their website and read a book while waiting for a callback.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We can&#8217;t change the past, but we can build a callback function with <a href="http://stamplay.com/">Stamplay</a>, <a href="http://twilio.com/voice">Twilio</a>, and <a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbounce</a>. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p><em>Psst&#8230;you can read the original blog post by Stamplay over <a href="https://blog.stamplay.com/create-a-call-back-landing-page-with-unbounce-and-twilio-1eb59bee8127#.lxg8w4kxg">here</a></em></p>
<h3>Configuring the Unbounce landing page</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19382" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2.png" alt="2" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2.png 600w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-300x187.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-200x125.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
Regardless from the starting template or graphical style of your Unbounce landing page the only thing that you really need is a Phone Number field.</p>
<p>If you’re starting from scratch you can find some templates on Unbounce that have the Phone Number form field already included like the Service Callback one.</p>
<p>If you already have your form in place just be sure to add a Phone Number field, you can add fields to your form by double-clicking on the form itself. A pop up window will be shown allowing you to select the field from the Pre-defined fields on the left.</p>
<p>Once this is completed let’s get a Twilio account.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19384" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4centered.png" alt="4centered" width="800" height="354" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4centered-300x133.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4centered-768x340.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4centered-200x89.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Getting Twilio Wired Up</h3>
<p>Create a <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio account</a>, buy a phone number, then head over to your Console Dashboard and find your Account SID and Auth Token. Copy the Account SID and Auth Token, we’re going to use them in a minute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19385" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/5centered.png" alt="5centered" width="800" height="366" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/5centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/5centered-300x137.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/5centered-768x351.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/5centered-200x92.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Configuring the Blueprint</h3>
<p>This app is available as a Blueprint, a pre-built template to help you get started with proven integration solutions. To get started <a href="https://editor.stamplay.com/blueprints/584ad122b2f257fcbc259546/start">click here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll be prompted to pick a name for your project and then a walkthrough wizard will start. After that Stamplay will prompt you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect your Unbounce account</li>
<li>Provide a couple of Twilio credentials</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19386" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6centered.png" alt="6centered" width="800" height="430" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6centered-300x161.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6centered-768x413.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6centered-200x108.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Once you have connected the two services click on Next.</p>
<h3>Connecting Your Landing Page to Your Phone Number</h3>
<p>Next step is to select the Unbounce page containing the Phone Number field, then select the Twilio number that will be used to call your lead. Then type the phone number that will be called after your lead pick up the phone. Just be sure to include your country code (e.g. +14152225555). Once this you’ve completed the above mentioned steps the last thing that you still have to do is to click on the link to complete your app configuration.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19387" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/7centered.png" alt="7centered" width="800" height="378" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/7centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/7centered-300x142.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/7centered-768x363.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/7centered-200x95.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19388" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8centered.png" alt="8centered" width="800" height="432" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8centered-300x162.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8centered-768x415.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8centered-200x108.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19389" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9centered.png" alt="9centered" width="800" height="370" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9centered-300x139.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9centered-768x355.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9centered-200x93.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>How It Works Behind The Scenes</h3>
<p>The blueprint is the result of mixing together all the key features of Stamplay, for the most curious here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>an API Flow that is triggered by the Unbounce landing page and start the phone call with Twilio</li>
<li>the persistent data storage</li>
<li>a NodeJS serverless function that generates the TwiML required by the Call action</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19390" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/10centered.png" alt="10centered" width="764" height="379" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/10centered.png 764w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/10centered-300x149.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/10centered-200x99.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Flow</h3>
<p>The scope of the Flow is to collect informations from Unbounce and the configuration of our app containing the phone number that will be connected with the new lead and pass it the Twilio action.</p>
<p>The Twilio takes in input some parameters which are: the number of our lead (passed from the unbounce trigger), the Twilio phone number which will make the call and the URL of a TwiML file.</p>
<p>TwiML is a set of instructions to tell Twilio what to do when you receive make a call or receive an SMS. When someone makes a call or sends an SMS to one of your Twilio numbers, Twilio will look up the URL associated with that phone number and make a request to that URL.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19392" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/12centered.png" alt="12centered" width="800" height="526" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/12centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/12centered-300x197.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/12centered-768x505.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/12centered-200x132.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19391" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11centered.png" alt="11centered" width="800" height="153" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11centered.png 800w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11centered-300x57.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11centered-768x147.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11centered-200x38.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The URL points to our Code Block <pre class="crayon-plain-tag">https://APPNAME.stamplayapp.com/api/codeblock/v1/run/get_twiml?connectwith={{NUMBER_FROM_SETTINGS}}&amp;first_name={{NAME}}</pre></p>
<h3>Responding With TwiML</h3>
<p>The NodeJS Code Block simply return an XML response containing a message (that you can customize as it pleases you) that will be read by the text-to-speech engine of Twilio and the phone number that will be connected with the Unbounce lead.</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">module.exports = function(context, req, res) {
 var connectwith = context.query.connectwith;
 var first_name = context.query.first_name;
 res.setHeader(‘x-custom-header’, ‘custom!’);
 res.writeHead(200, {‘Content-Type’: ‘text/xml’});
 res.end(`<?xml version=”1.0" encoding=”UTF-8"?>
 <Response>
 <Say voice=”alice”>Hey ${first_name} thanks for contacting our lovely callback service we’re connecting 
 you with our team right now, please hold on one second.</Say>
 <Dial>+${connectwith}</Dial>
 </Response>`);
};</pre><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;re good to go. Spare your customers from the United-style of customer service with the call back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ckl.io/">Cheesecake Labs</a>, a development shop,  built their SMS user verification app in less than a day using Python and Django. Here&#8217;s how it works from the user&#8217;s end. </p>
<p>        1. The user enters his/her phone number in the app</p>
<p>        2. The app pings the server, and the user quickly receives an SMS with a confirmation 6-digit pin-code.</p>
<p>        3. As soon as the user types the correct pin in the app, the phone number is validated.</p>
<p>This was iOS developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/salloummarcelo">Marcelo Salloum</a>&#8216;s first Twilio hack. Marcello wanted to create a verification feature that didn&#8217;t require the users to create a log-in and password. Instead, he used the username everyone has in their pocket at all times &#8212; your phone number.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the code he used to build the feature, which Marcello based off of <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/account-verification/python/flask#introduction">these docs</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Cheesecake Lab&#8217;s SMS Verification Solution &#8212; Built With Python + Django</strong></p>
<p>When a new user signs up, a http request is triggered through <pre class="crayon-plain-tag">@receiver(user_signed_up)</pre>, then the <pre class="crayon-plain-tag">SMSVerification</pre> model creates a pin code for that user and sends it to the user&#8217;s phone.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">class SMSVerification(TimestampedModel):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Thousands of strangers regaled <a href="http://twitter.com/laurenleto">Lauren Leto</a> with tales of their intimate exploits from the previous night. This was back in 2009, when she founded <a href="http://textsfromlastnight.com">Texts From Last Night</a> (TFLN). The internet ravenously consumed these strangers&#8217; stories.</div>
<div></div>
<div>TFLN was wildly successful. In the midst of that viral snowball rolling downhill, Lauren was pricked by a thought. The medium of TFLN’s success, the phone number, was broken. She didn’t know what to do about it yet, but she knew would do something.</div>
<h3>Lauren&#8217;s &#8220;Little Something&#8221;</h3>
<p><img src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-300x300.jpg" alt="laurenleto" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-19315" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-300x300.jpg 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-150x150.jpg 150w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-200x200.jpg 200w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-32x32.jpg 32w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-50x50.jpg 50w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-64x64.jpg 64w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-96x96.jpg 96w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto-128x128.jpg 128w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/laurenleto.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<div>With a tap, you can filter, mute, or silence almost any app on your phone. But the phone number itself remains a different beast. It’s hard to step away from calls and texts without literally stepping way from your phone. Lauren set out to fix this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>November 17th, Lauren&#8217;s “something” went live on Product Hunt. It’s name is Listen. You can text her about it &#8211; <strong>313.492.4177</strong></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Segmenting Messages By Sender, Time, And Whatever Else You Feel Like</h3>
<div>Listen works on the belief that not all calls and texts are equal. A text from family might hold more weight than a text from Comcast asking if you’re satisfied with your service (no, Comcast…I’m not.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Listen lets you segment users, mute others, schedule SMS reminders, and set up auto replies. Lauren found the mute feature particularly useful after the election. “Yeah, I had to mute some people,” she confesses.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Having the messaging floodgates open at all time can lead to mental fatigue and distractions. Lauren is hoping that Listen helps users do whatever they need to with their numbers, which is a newly found bit of freedom.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“There are times where you have to step away. The current operating systems don’t let you step away,” says Lauren.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Using Your Own Product&#8230;.To Mute Your Co-workers</h3>
<p><img src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ListenFeatures-300x126.png" alt="listenfeatures" width="300" height="126" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19314" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ListenFeatures-300x126.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ListenFeatures-768x323.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ListenFeatures-200x84.png 200w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ListenFeatures.png 795w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<div>Lauren built Listen over the course of three years, some on her own, some with friends, but most recently with Austen Ito. Somewhere in-between when Austen started working with Lauren in August and when Listen went live in November, they got in a tiff. The root cause: Venmo vs Square Cash. When Austen admitted Square Cash’s superiority, Lauren took advantage of the moment — using Listen.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“She kept texting me ‘I told you so’,” says Austen. “I had to mute her.” Ah, the freedom to step away.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>That Fateful Day</h3>
<div>The fateful day Listen went live, Ryan Hoover, the  Founder of Product Hunt posted his number in the comment section. It was a sign of faith that Lauren took to heart. At the same time, Listen’s customer support line was piling up with messages.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lauren was expecting the messages you’d usually find in a customer support inbox &#8211; &#8220;this is broken,&#8221; &#8220;I don’t like this.&#8221; Instead, she found &#8220;thank you&#8221; after &#8220;thank you.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lauren is getting fewer texts from strangers with Texts From Last Night in her past, but she seems alright with that. These ones likely mean more, and they mean her special something is working.</div>

It’s not yours, but you’re in it. The people walking through the car park are real. Some of them could be actors. The car park is pretty close to where you met the rest of the people who are part of the game.</p>
<p>The plot seems familiar, like a story you absorb through osmosis after falling asleep with the news on. A politician is on the brink of passing a critical climate change bill, meeting the ire powerful energy corporations in the process.</p>
<p>The bit that seems like outright fantasy is your task &#8212; to make sure the bill passes while unearthing a secret that could jeopardize the bill. The moment your suspension of disbelief starts to wane, a phone in the glovebox starts ringing. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, You&#8217;re Really Hacking a Fake Voicemail</strong></p>
<p>You hack into a politician&#8217;s voicemail account. Right after you hang up, a text from a shadowy character demands your attention. The moment is either serendipitous or expertly programed. <i>(Pssst&#8230;it’s the latter). </i>But, whatever force delivered the message, the feeling is the same.</p>
<p>In reality, you should not hack your co-worker’s voicemail. But the game’s air of fantasy gives you the muster to hack various contact’s voicemails.</p>
<p>You’re looking for spy-game clues, not looking for the man behind the curtain. That man is <a href="http://johnsear.com">John Sear</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Weaving Fantasy Into the Blanket of Reality</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theotherwayworks.co.uk/portfolio/a-moment-of-madness/">A Moment Of Madness</a>, elegant Twilio engineering rides on the back of a crafty narrative to blur the line between reality and fantasy. Sear is a veteran game designer, working with immersive theater companies to build productions that turn “reality into a blanket and a platform for the game.” Together with Katie Day of the theatre company <a href="http://www.theotherwayworks.co.uk/">The Other Way Works</a> and writer <a href="http://timwright.typepad.com/">Tim Wright</a>, they built a game to get lost in.</p>
<p>John Sear uses various Twilio numbers and recordings of trained actors to build voicemail accounts. Critical contacts in the game all have voicemail accounts that players mine for information. While information itself is fake, the encounter is eerily real</p>
<p>The game’s “blanket of reality” turns a car in a car park into counter-espionage headquarters for you and your partner. You have to have a partner because, as John points out, “a single player experience was terrifying &#8212; calling strangers, being a spy on your own in a car park. When it’s two-player, it’s fun. You’re like ‘What’s our spy name again?’&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Trading In Your Real Name for Your Spy Name</strong></p>
<p>When you’re playing <a href="http://www.theotherwayworks.co.uk/portfolio/a-moment-of-madness/">A Moment Of Madness</a>, you should forget you’re playing a game. Sear keeps players submerged in a fantasy by adding the tiny trappings of reality. If you’re coming up short on clues while thumbing through the dossier you found in your glove box, you can phone a friend (or fellow spy).</p>
<p>John tracks how players are advancing through the game by monitoring the litany of Twilio numbers powering the game’s texts, calls and voicemails. He built a C# app to display webhook data in realtime so map every moment along the player’s journey from when they first text “we’re in” when they get in the car, to when they finally crack a secret voicemail account.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19304" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot-1024x577.png" alt="MoM" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot-1024x577.png 1024w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot-300x169.png 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot-768x432.png 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot-200x113.png 200w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MoM-Game-screenshot.png 1586w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When the spy-gaming us up, all the different groups meet back where they started and exchange intel. They have to make a final decision on what they’ll do with the information they’ve amassed. This is the part of the game John can’t control &#8212; the human part. In an otherwise carefully engineered system, this is a variable John doesn’t try to control with code. Whatever choice the group makes to determine the fate of the climate bill, the politician, and their spy career is their call &#8212; one they’re making in a world John built.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In August of 2016, torrential downpours caused catastrophic flooding across Southern Louisiana. It dropped the equivalent of 7.1 trillion gallons of water, devastating parishes across the state. Louisianaians were salvaging what they could from the disaster, while scrambling to find a way to prepare their kids for the first day of school. Many low income residents did not have the financial means to replace their kids’ school supplies lost in the flooding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teamcomeback.org/">Team Comeback Kids</a> raced against the clock, rallying to help their neighbors. In a matter of a month, they delivered over one million dollars in school supplies to kids across Louisiana in time for their first day at school. Delivering over 9,500 backpacks across the state with no time to spare is a logistical endeavor as much as it is an altruistic one. Comeback Kids used Twilio SMS, powered by <a href="https://www.twilio.org/">Twilio.org</a>, to assemble and empower volunteer squad to help the kids of Louisiana.</p>
<h3>A Fantastic Opportunity (Presented in the Form of a Logistical Nightmare)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19240" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics-1024x576.jpg" alt="logistics" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics-300x169.jpg 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics-768x432.jpg 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics-200x112.jpg 200w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Logistics.jpg 1268w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
Pallets of school supplies arrived at New Orleans’ Saints star <a href="http://www.neworleanssaints.com/team/roster/Thomas-Morstead/4c89fb55-43c2-4f88-85f3-05438a98ffaf">Thomas Morstead</a>’s charity <a href="https://www.wygwg.com/">What You Give Will Grow</a> (WYGWG). Team Comeback Kids, a division of WYGWG, had a plan to get the much-needed supplies to kids, but they didn’t have the manpower. The stockpile of supplies had to be distributed in one weekend. It was Friday.</p>
<p>Team Comeback kids sent one SMS blast to their volunteers that Friday. Ten minutes later, they had the 30 volunteers they needed. By the end of the weekend, those supplies were out of their headquarters and in the hands of kids.</p>
<p>Dennis Lomonaco, Executive Director of WYGWG, sent the text blast to volunteers himself, calling it a “eureka moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten minutes later we were set,” said Lomonaco. “That would have never happened with email.”</p>
<h3>Mobilizing an Army of Volunteers</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19243" src="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team-1024x683.jpg" alt="team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team-200x133.jpg 200w, https://twilioinc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Team.jpg 1069w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>“The texting platform allowed us to get near 100% open rates and responses within minutes of sending. With email, our open rates were never close to that high, and even when they did get read, it could take a day or more,” said Lomonaco.</p>
<p>Using the Frontline SMS platform, powered by Twilio, Dennis can send SMS to curated lists of volunteers without having to write a line of code. “A lot of nonprofit work we do is limited by the tech stack we have available,” says Lomonaco. The Frontline SMS platform put the Twilio API in reach for Lomonaco.</p>
<p>Now that kids affected by the flood are back in school, fully equipped with desperately needed supplies, Lomonaco is shifting his focus. With his other venture, <a href="https://www.storyblock.media/">Story Block Media</a>, he is aiming to give nonprofits access to the tools they need to help others with a quickness.</p>
<p>“We want to create a one stop shop for nonprofits to communicate with the donors and volunteers and all the people they need to talk to,” says Dennis. “Communication is the biggest struggle for nonprofits in or out of disasters.”</p>

Sure, he&#8217;s a proud Michigan Wolverine, a former CTO, now a CEO, but he&#8217;s a software person first. Following that mindset guided Jeff from Versity all the way to Twilio. If Versity doesn&#8217;t ring a bell, Jeff can give you a refresher. It was the first software business he founded. Versity delivered better class notes to college students. Twilio&#8217;s mission is a little bit different. But, what ties Twilio and Versity together is the software mindset. </p>
<p>In his AWS reInvent Keynote, Jeff runsdown how that software mindset guides Twilio, and ensures agility and reliability.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a 2,280 trek from my desk to Indiana, the home state of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=3&#038;cad=rja&#038;uact=8&#038;ved=0ahUKEwj0mJOUibvQAhVrhlQKHTxNADkQFgg2MAI&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F80057281&#038;usg=AFQjCNGpukbaABCvyRCrAV02QAvjYtJMhw&#038;sig2=uiY0ceyUOVBjVrPNx3UAdg">Stranger Things</a>. </p>
<p>I will forgo any attempt to calculate my commute to the Upside Down. Not only do I have no interest in grappling with the Demogorgon, but <a href="http://www.popsci.com/tackling-stranger-things-parallel-universes-and-state-string-theory">any respected physicist will tell you it&#8217;s hard to pin down the Upside Down&#8217;s coordinate</a>s. It could be beneath me at this very moment, or in another universe. </p>
<p>You can safely bring one hallmark of Stranger Things to your home without a cross country roadtrip, or summoning a beast from another dimension. <a href="https://twitter.com/rajington">Rajarshi Nigam</a> engineered Stranger Thing&#8217;s rope lights &#8211; an interdimensional telephone &#8211; into existence. Check out his full rundown <a href="https://www.hackster.io/rajington/stranger-things-lights-sign-costume-14132e?ref=user&#038;ref_id=37227&#038;offset=0">here</a>.<br />

<p>This time they&#8217;re not powered by otherworldly forces, but rather by Firebase, Twilio, Zapier, and some hardware tinkering. When you send a text to your Twilio number, your Stranger Things lights will spell out the message you sent. If Will Byers had a cell phone and this hack, his life would be a lot easier. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe-zq4bFPFU">iconic scene</a> in Portlandia where Fred Armisen spirals downwards, trapped in a technology loop. The chime of a SMS alert takes Fred from his Netflix queue to his phone, which takes him to Facebook, until his email calls his attention. This probably sounds familiar. But, for customer service reps, this likely feels familiar. You bounce from one platform to another, tracking down pieces of the same pie in different places.</p>
<p><a href="http://talkus.io/">Talkus</a> built a customer helpdesk platform using only two things &#8211; Twilio SMS and Slack. When a customer texts you, it opens a Slack conversation with all  the relevant information you need in one place: the customer&#8217;s name, location, previous chat history, and their message.</p>
<p>We talked with Talkus founder and engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/acemtp">Vianney Lecroart</a> about the need for simplicity in helpdesk software.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got any questions for the Talkus team, shoot them a text. They&#8217;re using their own hack to reply <strong>415 523 8899</strong>.</p>

<h3>Fitting An Entire Helpdesk Into Slack</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What inspired you to build Talkus?</h4>
<p>Chats is everywhere now. In our personal life we use smartphones to send text messages, use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and every other message applications. In professional life we use chat within tools like Slack but also Facebook at Work, Microsoft Teams etc.</p>
<p>Chatting is the simplest way to communicate between people but also between people and companies.</p>
<p>We created Talkus to build an omnichannel contact centre between live chat on website, emails, phone and text messages (thanks to Twilio) in a single, increasingly popular place: <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>
<h4>How&#8217;d you build Talkus?</h4>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/De1754ocRBs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><br />
Twilio enabled a new business model for Talkus; a business we knew existed but that was a bit too distant for us at the moment.</p>
<p>The Twilio the integration of SMS into Talkus was extremely simple. A few webhooks and API calls and that was it. In a few hours we had a proof of concept and then after a few days we were ready to launch this new feature.</p>
<p>Without Twilio, we wouldn’t even have considered integrating text messages. It would have been way too much work for our small team.</p>
<h4>What Do your customer typically use the Slack + SMS combo for?</h4>
<p>The most obvious case is for companies that want to help customers that are relying on mobile phones.</p>
<p>We have a client that services restaurants. For restaurant owners, the easiest way to contact the supplier is to send a text, they often don’t have a computer near them but they always have a phone.</p>
<p>With Twilio, customer support became so simple that restaurants just love Talkus. As for the supplier they are finding it pretty straightforward to handle requests right into Slack.</p>
<p>Some of our customers have surprised us with a usage that we had not imagined at first.</p>
<p>Take for example, <a href="https://getcleanio.com">Cleanio</a>. They offer to come at your home, pick up your laundry and deliver your washed and ironed clothes back at your home. They use Talkus to liaise with their customers, primarily using email and live chat. But they also use Talkus to have two-way communication with their drivers via text messages. In both cases Cleanio handle everything inside Slack.</p>
<h4>What languages and frameworks did you use to build the integration?</h4>
<p>Talkus is 100% Javascript, Node.js and <a href="http://meteor.com">MeteorJS</a>. Twilio is so simple to use that we didn’t even use the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node">twilio-node helper library</a>, just the old plain cool <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest">REST API.</a><br />

<p><em>The distance from an idea to a deploy is only a few webhooks. Talkus bridged that gap. You can do the same with the help of the <a href="http://twilio.com/docs">docs</a>.</em></p>
